This Agreement governs your use of the Xverse Application (including all related documentation, the &quot;Application&quot;). The Application is licensed, not sold, to you.</p><p>‍<br/>BY CLICKING THE &quot;AGREE&quot; BUTTON, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, USING THE APPLICATION, YOU (A) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT; (B) REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT; AND (C) ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY BOUND BY ITS TERMS.

Services; Non-Custodial Wallet; Stacking Pool. You acknowledge and agree that the Application is providing you with a list of features and services as a non-custodial wallet. Only you have access to the wallet, and the Company does not have access to the wallet. The Company is not responsible and is not able to recover any lost wallet keys. By using the Stacking pool features, you acknowledge that you are familiar with the stacking protocol to fully comprehend and appreciate the involved risks of Stacking. You will be accessing the Stacking protocol’s built-in mechanism, “delegation”, which allows Stacks token holders to participate even if they don’t meet the minimum number of tokens requirements for Stacking. You understand the risks of “delegation”, and shall be fully responsible for your decision in locking your tokens to another party and any such locked duration. You understand that your tokens do not leave your wallet during the “delegation” process. They remain locked in place once Stacking starts for the duration of Stacking you choose to participate. To participate in Stacking, you are required to provide the Application with a Bitcoin address for the purpose of receiving the distributed rewards at the start of delegation.  Upon completion of a Stacking cycle, the Stacking pool will distribute the received rewards in proportion to your delegated amount, minus an Access Fee payable to the Application. You agree to pay such Access Fee from your stacking rewards; and understand and agree such Access Fee may be changed from time to time by the Company, at is sole discretion. Details of the Access Fee can be found in-app before you start the Stacking process.</p><p>‍<br/>5.	STACKING RISK FACTORS. “CRYPTOCURRENCIES” REFERS TO DISTRIBUTED, DECENTRALIZED PEER-TO-PEER DIGITAL CURRENCIES, COINS, OR TOKENS, AND ACTIONS WITH CRYPTOCURRENCIES CARRY INHERENT RISKS.  CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE UNINSURED, FOR MOST PARTS UNREGULATED, AND DECENTRALIZED, AND THE VALUE OF ANY STACKING OR ANY AMOUNT OF ANY CRYPTOCURRENCY IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO FLUCTUATING MARKET PRICES.  STACKING IS A FEATURE OF THE STACKS BLOCKCHAIN WHICH ALLOWS USERS TO LOCK THEIR STACK TOKENS IN THEIR OWN WALLETS AND RECEIVE BITCOIN REWARDS. END USER ACCEPTS AND AGREES THAT THE STACKS BLOCKCHAIN IS COMPLETELY DECENTRALIZED AND THUS COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL OVER ITS PROTOCOL. END USER FURTHER AGREES THAT DIGITAL ASSETS SUCH AS CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND/OR TOKENS ARE HIGHLY VOLATILE. COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY END USER’S FINANCIAL DECISIONS INCLUDING THE DECISION TO STACK USING THE APPLICATION OR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM OR PROTOCOL OFFERED BY COMPANY. END USER FURTHER AGREES THAT COMPANY SHALL TAKE AN ACCESS FEE OF THE POOLED REWARDS AS ITS FEE. END USER UNDERSTANDS THAT COMPANY IS SOLELY A SOFTWARE SERVICE, AND IS NOT A BANK, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, FUND, OR CREDITOR. END USER SHALL USE ITS OWN BEST JUDGMENT WHEN MAKING FINANCIAL DECISIONS AND WARRANTS TO COMPANY THAT IT HAS THE CAPACITY TO DO SO. COMPANY SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR END USERS FINANCIAL LOSSES ARISING EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM USE OF THE APPLICATION OR ANY OTHER COMPANY PROTOCOL. THE COMPANY MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE AS TO HOW MUCH STACKING REWARDS, IF ANY AT ALL, THE END USER WILL RECEIVE DURING THE LOCKED STACKING PERIOD.</p><p>‍<br/>6.	Collection and Use of Your Information. You acknowledge that when you download, install, or use the Application, Company may use automatic means (including, for example, cookies and web beacons) to collect information about your Device and about your use of the Application. You also may be required to provide certain information about yourself as a condition to downloading, installing, or using the Application or certain of its features or functionality, and the Application may provide you with opportunities to share information about yourself with others. All information we collect through or in connection with this Application is subject to our Privacy Policy. By downloading, installing, using, and providing information to or through this Application, you consent to all actions taken by us with respect to your information in compliance with the Privacy Policy.</p><p>6.1	Bitcoin Transaction Accelerator. Our Application contains a Replace-By-Fee (“RBF”) feature. The RBF features allows you to replace your unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction with a different version of that transaction that has a higher transaction fee. Further details of the feature and the transaction fees for such feature is available on the Application. </p><p>6.2	You understand that if you use the RBF feature, you will be initiating a Bitcoin transfer with a specific fee, flagging it as replaceable and indicating that you may want to update that fee later, before you broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin Network; if the transaction is taking too long to confirm, you can create a new one with the same inputs, but at a higher fee; on confirmation, the new transaction will invalidate the old one, preventing the possibility of a double spend. Replacement transactions must follow certain rules; you must first signal for RBF by flagging a payment as RBF-enabled when originally broadcasting it; for unconfirmed inputs, you can spend any unspent Bitcoins; your replacement transaction must have a higher fee than the original, and the increase must be at least equal to the minimum relay fee (the lowest fee that the network will accept); your transactions must have the same outputs, as the new transaction sends funds to the same address(es) as before.<br/><br/>6.3	By using the RBF features, you acknowledge and agree that you are familiar with the RBF mechanism and the risk involved. Through RBF, you will be replacing your original payment with a double-spend copy. You understand that there are numerous risks including but not limited to: the main risk for the RBF feature is that there is potential confusion if the recipient sees pending payments that seem to appear and disappear in their wallet, and that extra diligence is needed when leveraging RBF; you could accidentally invalidate your original transactions; the recipient may see the pending transaction appear and disappear from their wallets, which may confuse them; other users may front-run your replacement by offering higher fees; and RBF’s technical complexity may be challenging to set up and lead to mistakes.</p><p>‍<br/>7.
